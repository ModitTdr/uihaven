UI haven is a project I've develop that helps in planning and designing. It provides font pairing which helps you to find find that complements!😉. Moodboard is another feature that provides a canvas to collect images in one place.


## Problem Statement
I have a love for design and for planning a project and I have not been able to find a tool that helps me to plan and design.
Pairing right that perfectlly complements is something that I have not been able to do. And also I have not been able to find a tool that helps me to collect images in one place.

- Live Font pairing previews with realtime control over the text and fonts
- Moodboard to collect images in one place
